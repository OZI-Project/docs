# Test Policy

The purpose of this document is to communicate the policy for testing of new and updated software,

## Our goals for testing

- To ensure our safety-related systems do not cause inaccuracy or delay to our products
- To ensure our software maintains the good reputation of the organisation
- To support our agile processes, allowing frequent releases containing valuable changes to our users
- To spend our time on the most valuable testing activities

## Scope of testing

Our testing covers functional and non-functional areas as described in our [strategy](test-strategy.md).

## Who tests

The Test Practice consists of a group of test engineers who provide a testing capability across software delivery teams.  It also provides oversight of the testing activities of our delivery partners.

## Who manages Testing

Software Engineering Team Managers line manage all test engineers.  However, test engineers are task-managed by the delivery programs in conjunction with the Head of Software Engineering.

## The Testing Life-Cycle

In summary, a standard Test Approach document must be written at the start of developing the Beta product, and a Test Summary Report must be created and signed off by stakeholders before the Beta is released.

## Testing Processes

Test processes may differ by team or project, according to individual circumstances.  All test approaches must conform to the [test strategy](test-strategy.md).

## Test data

It is policy that live data should not be used for testing. Where a copy of live data is used then its use is to be risk assessed and the data sanitised as appropriate, removing references to customers, employees, personal identifying information, and corporate proprietary information.
