Public OZI API documentation, software engineering practices, and developer guides.

API Documentation
-----------------

This project serves as the host repository for our `documentation site <https://ozi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ at ReadTheDocs.io.

Software Engineering
--------------------

These are the guiding principles for OZI's development:

* `Reproducible builds <https://reproducible-builds.org/>`_ (via Meson)
* Configuration as code
* No is temporary but yes is forever
