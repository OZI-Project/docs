.. card:: :octicon:`milestone;1.5em;sd-text-info` Version: 0.1

    The current milestone version is 0.1, meaning that for OZI to release version 0.1
    the project committers will need to satisfy the OZI specification.

.. card:: :octicon:`milestone;1.5em;sd-text-info` Status: Alpha

    The current milestone status is Alpha, meaning that for OZI to change the status from
    Pre-Alpha to Alpha the committers need to satisfy the OZI specification.

.. card:: :octicon:`milestone;1.5em;sd-text-info` Specification: 🚧 Work in Progress 🚧

    Currently the spec is being actively developed alongside the Pre-Alpha releases.
    This means that we will pin each specification card to a ``.. versionadded:: 0.1``
    and change the ``API Specification: ...`` title here before work begins on an Alpha
    release.
