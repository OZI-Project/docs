Completed Milestones
--------------------

.. card:: :octicon:`milestone;1.5em;sd-text-info` Test Policy

    This covers multiple OpenSSF Silver attestations:

    * :octicon:`check;1em;sd-text-info` automated_integration_testing
    * :octicon:`check;1em;sd-text-info` regression_tests_added50
    * :octicon:`check;1em;sd-text-info` test_policy_mandated

Works in Progress
-----------------

.. card:: :octicon:`milestone;1.5em;sd-text-info` Version: 0.1

    The current milestone version is 0.1, meaning that for OZI to release version 0.1
    the project committers will need to satisfy the OZI specification.

.. card:: :octicon:`milestone;1.5em;sd-text-info` Status: Alpha

    The current milestone status is Alpha, meaning that for OZI to change the status from
    Pre-Alpha to Alpha the committers need to satisfy the OZI specification.

.. card:: :octicon:`milestone;1.5em;sd-text-info` Specification

    Currently the spec is being actively developed alongside the Pre-Alpha releases.
    This means that we will pin each specification card to a ``.. versionadded:: 0.1``
    and change the ``API Specification: ...`` title here before work begins on an Alpha
    release.

.. card:: :octicon:`milestone;1.5em;sd-text-info` Accessibility Best Practices

    This is an OpenSSF Silver attestation.

.. card:: :octicon:`milestone;1.5em;sd-text-info` Internationalization and Localization

    This is an OpenSSF Silver attestation.

.. card:: :octicon:`milestone;1.5em;sd-text-info` Vulnerability Response Process

    This is an OpenSSF Silver attestation.

Help Needed
-----------

.. card:: :octicon:`people;1.5em;sd-text-info` Bus Factor

    This is an OpenSSF Silver attestation.
    Currently the bus factor is one; just the project lead.


.. card:: :octicon:`people;1.5em;sd-text-info` Access Continuity

    This is an OpenSSF Silver attestation.
    We have yet to setup access continuity. When committers are more active in OZI
    we will need to create a means of continuity.
