.. card:: Milestone Version: 0.1

    The current milestone version is 0.1, meaning that for OZI to release version 0.1
    the maintainers need to satisfy the OZI specification.

.. card:: Milestone Status: Alpha

    The current milestone status is Alpha, meaning that for OZI to change the status from
    Pre-Alpha to Alpha the maintainers need to satisfy the OZI specification.

.. card:: API Specification: ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

    Currently the spec is being actively developed alongside the Pre-Alpha releases.
    This means that we will pin each specification to a ``.. versionadded:: 0.1`` and change 
    the ``API Specification: ...`` title here before work begins on an Alpha release.
